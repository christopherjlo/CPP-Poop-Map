Technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL

Tired of not knowing where your friends at CPP poop? This web app can solve all your needs! Post poop locations, add friends, and see where they pooped!

This is a web-based version of the popular gag app Poop Map, with a focus on Cal Poly Pomona students. Users can create accounts, add other accounts as friends, and drop poops/markers onto a map. Poops are recorded in a mySQL AWS RDS using the Geolocation API, and are then displayed on a map using the Google Maps API.
